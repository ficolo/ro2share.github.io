This project makes it possible for users to claim and curate from the SHARE repository
The flow of actions is simple 
1- ORCID, users login with their ORCID ids. We make use of the ORCID API 
2- Items are retrieved from the SHARE repostory 
3- Users claim from the retrieved list of objects 
4- Users establish relations across claimed objects 
5- Users can export their metadata bundles as DISCOs or ROs 
The workflow has been extended by adding other repositories. In addition, the claim module has been improved by making it possible to curate the claimed objects
The FAIR principles, and guidelines whenever available, are being applied to the resulting bundle and curation process
